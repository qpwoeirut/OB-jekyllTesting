<h1 class="display-4 text-center">The Robert Katende Initiative</h1>
<br>

<p>The Robert Katende Initiative(Som Chess Academy) is a non-profit organization that helps youngsters in the slums realize their full potential through chess and educational support,
  by providing guidance in regards to management of daily challenges in life, enhancing abstract thinking, creativity
  and innovation. The Academy was started in 2004 by Coach Robert Katende who introduced chess in the slums of Katwe. Today they serve five different 
  slums in Kampala, seven villages in Gulu and one community in Jinja. Check out the website, <a href="https://www.robertkatende.org">Robert Katende Foundation</a>.

        <h5 class="mt-0">Collaboration:</h5>
        <p>Our collaboration with the Robert Katende started in March of 2024 with an inital meeting between officers and through quick action from both sides resulted
          in a set of weekly classes planned for the following weeks. In these classes we taught a total of 6 inital students Beginning to Intermediate level Python.These lessons continued
          a total of 9 weeks and ended with the students creating a text-based game based on a story they created. It is our goal to continue working with the Robert Katende Initiative 
          offering further courses and reaching out to more students.
